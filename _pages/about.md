Welcome! I am Austin Mendoza, a computational neuroscientist working in the [Haas Lab](https://bio.cas.lehigh.edu/faculty-staff/julie-haas/haas-lab) at Lehigh University. 
I am in the process of completing my Ph.D. investigating electrially coupled networks of thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) neurons, and how they might influence sensory attention and information flow from the thalamus to cortex. 
More info about my research interests and computational models can be found in the [research](research) section. 

My research papers can be found listed in the [publications](publications) section.

excerpt: 'Electrical synapses couple inhibitory neurons across the brain, underlying a variety of functions that are modifiable by activity. Despite recent advances, many functions and contributions of electrical synapses within neural circuitry remain underappreciated. Among these are the sources and impacts of electrical synapse asymmetry. Using multi-compartmental models of neurons coupled through dendritic electrical synapses, we investigated intrinsic factors that contribute to effective synaptic asymmetry and that result in modulation of spike timing and synchrony between coupled cells. We show that electrical synapse location along a dendrite, input resistance, internal dendritic resistance, or directional conduction of the electrical synapse itself each alter asymmetry as measured by coupling between cell somas. Conversely, we note that asymmetrical gap junction (GJ) conductance can be masked by each of these properties. Furthermore, we show that asymmetry modulates spike timing and latency of coupled cells by up to tens of milliseconds, depending on direction of conduction or dendritic location of the electrical synapse. Coordination of rhythmic activity between two cells also depends on asymmetry. These simulations illustrate that causes of asymmetry are diverse, may not be apparent in somatic measurements of electrical coupling, influence dendritic processing, and produce a variety of outcomes on spiking and synchrony of coupled cells. Our findings highlight aspects of electrical synapses that should always be included in experimental demonstrations of coupling, and when assembling simulated networks containing electrical synapses.'

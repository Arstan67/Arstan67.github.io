title: "Intrinsic Sources and Functional Impacts of Asymmetry at Electrical Synapses"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-02-08-Asymmetry
excerpt: 'Asymmetry, or unequal transmission of current between two coupled neurons, is a property of electrical synapses often noted but seldom explored. Here, we show that multiple intrinsic factors can either produce, or mask, asymmetry. Spike timing and rhythmic synchrony are both affected by asymmetric connections between neurons. These results highlight important consequences of asymmetry that are likely to be recapitulated within coupled networks throughout the brain.'
